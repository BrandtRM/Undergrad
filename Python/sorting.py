## The following function runs one of the sorting algorithm on lists

## comparisons, and total number of operations, and their corresponding scaling
## factor.
## Here the scaling factor shows how the number of total operations increases
## when the list size doubles. If the algorithm is O(n^2), then the scaling
## factor should approach 4 when the list size is large.
